// activity.js — the administrative activity log shown to Admin.
// It records account and system events, plus a privacy-safe line for each approval decision and
// reimbursement (who acted, approve/reject/reimbursed, expense ID, when). Expense titles, amounts and comments are NEVER
// written here — the full decision (with comment) lives in the expense's own `history`, visible
// only to the employee and their manager. So the Admin can audit activity without seeing spending.
//
// ActivityEntry { id, actorId, action, targetType, targetId, summary, createdAt }
